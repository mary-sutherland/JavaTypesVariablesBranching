    //DATA TYPES: CHAR

    // need to rename answer here as I've already defined it above as a boolean
    //char answer = 'Y'; // 'Y' as the explicit character value
    //char middleInitialC = 0x0043; //'C' as a hexadecimal

    // this char lowerCaseA below is throwing an error though not sure why
    //char lowerCaseA = \u0061; // 'a' as a unicode
    //char capitalK = 75; // 'K' as an integer value

    //CHAR variables can be initialized as either explicit characters or as a numeric
    //representation based on the ASCII value
    //When printed the value of capitalK will be printed as the upper case 'K' not the
    //numerical value of 75. The fact that char values can be initialized with numbers
    //can come in very handy.

    //LONG NUMBERS
    ///For the longer number variables, a suffix and specific formatting can be used to
    //ensure proper intention is noted

//    long BigLong = 230L;  // long (1, L)
//    float SomeFloat = 927.43f;  // float (f, F)
//    double someDbl = 392.2d;  //double (d, D)
//    double wishfulSalary = 123_000_100_325.0d; // stored/printed as 123000100325.0
